# Vue SPA Boilerplate

Setup I always use for Vue projects (Vue single-page app with Vuex, Vue Router, Vuetify, and Webpack)

Includes:

- Webpack
- Babel
- Vuex
- Vue Router
- Vuetify
- Node.js/Express backend (Notoe: If you don't want to use Node.js, just delete the folder and use `npm run dev-client` instead)
