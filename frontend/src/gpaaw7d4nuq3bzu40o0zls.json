          "The Anki development team is constantly releasing changes to Anki that break ours and many other add-ons. This forces us to spend a large amount of time and effort to identify new issues, troubleshoot with users, and then develop and release the fixes. This negatively impacts our productivity on larger upcoming, long-term projects, and diminishes time that could be used to add new features to our currently released add-ons that would increase the value they provide.",
          "Since maintaining support for the latest Anki versions has a constant negative impact on our productivity, we have decided that we would like to establish a development cycle methodology in our work. In order to work on other long-term projects in the most effective way, we would need a development cycle length of at least 4-6 months. We currently have some really big plans, and therefore a development cycle of 6 months would help us the most in making rapid progress towards those goals. Although we personally prefer a 6 month cycle we want to be able to gain a better understanding on your opinions through the questions below.",
          "By development cycle, we do not mean that we won't be releasing new add-ons, fixes, or new features to existing add-ons. We mean that all add-on updates would be for the Anki version we select at the beginning of a development cycle, and after the development cycle (e.x 6 months), we would update the add-ons to the latest, stable Anki version. For example, if we chose to release add-on updates for Anki version 2.1.22, and Anki releases version 2.1.23, we would only guarantee that the addons are compatible with Anki 2.1.22 - at the end of the development cycle (e.x 6 months), we would update all of our add-ons to the latest stable Anki version and begin a new development cycle.",
          "We have some major long term projects planned and really want to expedite and deliver on them."
