          "The Anki development team is constantly releasing breaking changes to Anki that affect MIA add-ons, forcing us to spend a large amount of time and effort to identify new issues, troubleshoot with users, and then release the fixes to everyone. This kills our productivity towards upcoming, long-term projects, and diminishes time that could be used to add new features to add-ons that would increase the value they already provide.",
          "Since maintaining support for the latest Anki versions constantly derails our productivity, we have decided that we would like to establish a development cycle methodology in our work. In order to work on other long-term projects in the most effective way, we would need a development cycle length of at least 4-6 months. We currently have some really big plans, and a development cycle as long as 6 months would help us immensely in achieving those goals. We wanted to personally ask you for your opinion on this through the questions below.",
          "By development cycle, we do not mean that we won't be releasing new add-ons, fixes, or new features to existing add-ons. We mean that all add-on updates would be for the Anki version we select at the beginning of a development cycle, and after the development cycle (e.x 6 months), we would update the add-ons to the latest, stable Anki version. For example, if we chose to release add-on updates for Anki version 2.1.22, and Anki releases version 2.1.23, we would only guarantee that the addons are compatible with Anki 2.1.22 - at the end of the development cycle (e.x 6 months), we would update all of our add-ons to the latest stable Anki version and begin a new development cycle.",
          "We have some major long term projects planned and really want to expedite and deliver on them."
