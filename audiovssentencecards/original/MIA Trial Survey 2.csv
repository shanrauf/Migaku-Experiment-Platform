I either tend to fail these ones more or unintentionally put sentences with words with too difficult to remember kanji in them. I've noticed that I've started putting easier sentences, but with kanji I interpret as more important to visually learn, in text sentences. Audio sentence reps go by significantly faster and I tend to remember them way easier though I'm worried I'm not actually learning the kanji I don't know in some words.","16","8","1","25","25","6","1","1","4","4","3","4","2","4"
