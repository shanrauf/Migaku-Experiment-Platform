# MIA Experiment

- Manage different experiments and surveys
- User interface for building the form
- Customizable fields and styles
- Analyze data across experiments

# Workflow:

1. User creates an account
2. User registers for an experiment
3. User fills out the surveys related to an experiment (within their deadlines)
4. User sends Anki data after having submitted each survey - this data is "associated" with that week's survey
5. User cannot send their Anki data or submit the same survey more than once
